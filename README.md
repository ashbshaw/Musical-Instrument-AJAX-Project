This page allows the user to click an "instrument" button in order to view 10 related gifs along with the rating of each (g, pg, etc.). Every time a new instrument button is clicked, the fresh gifs appear ahead of the older gifs. The user may also add additional buttons and display gifs that are the topic of the user's choice.

This page is a fun way to view gifs about musical instruments. For more information, please contact Ashley Shaw @ ashley.brooke.shaw@gmail.com.
